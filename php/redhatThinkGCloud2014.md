## Let's TALK about the RED HAT model...

--

## Many variations vendors take on open source

* Some enable optimizations for their hardware <!-- .element: class="fragment" data-fragment-index="1" -->
* Some use open-core to upsell proprietary add-ons <!-- .element: class="fragment" data-fragment-index="2" -->
* Some invest in focused areas <!-- .element: class="fragment" data-fragment-index="3" -->
* Some contribute little and soley ship and support <!-- .element: class="fragment" data-fragment-index="4" -->

--

## AND SOME...
# GO ALL IN <!-- .element: class="fragment" data-fragment-index="1" -->

## Is Open Source a Business Model?

* No <!-- .element: class="fragment" data-fragment-index="1" -->
* But it is the best DEVELOPMENT model on the planet <!-- .element: class="fragment" data-fragment-index="2" -->
* Enables collaboration <!-- .element: class="fragment" data-fragment-index="3" -->
* Gives users flexibility to consume on their terms <!-- .element: class="fragment" data-fragment-index="4" -->

## Recap - Why are we doing this cloud thing anyway?

* Save money? - maybe
* Agility - turn our infrastructure into a PAYG utility model
* Lock in - Wastage of procurement... - repeat locking of proprietary in the cloud.

--

## Now we need some buzzwords

--

## Pets vs Cattle

slide on this to make the point

--

## Continuous Delivery

--

## Lean

--

## Devops

devops recap

---

## Infrastructure as Code - software defined cloud - software defined data centre

the implication of devops is infrastructure as code

---

## Up in the G-Clouds

* We have many G-Clouds
* Clouds have different security classifications
* Clouds have different APIs - tied to the cloud provider

---

## Tying it all together

* How do we "plumb" an application together that has different bits in different clouds?
	* My data might be in one cloud
	* My main application(s) are in a different cloud
	* I might have a REST API exposed that runs in a third cloud
*

---

## What do these have in common?

* They are all examples of next-generation IT solutions
* They were started by users and developers, not companies

---

## Cloud without open source software?
* No Amazon
