### First lets talk about some **principles** for selecting software
Lets call them Jeremy's golden rules for buying ;-)

1. Software for your enterprise needs to be proven and ready for production <!-- .element: class="fragment" data-fragment-index="1" -->
2. Everything you run in production should have long term enterprise grade support <!-- .element: class="fragment" data-fragment-index="2" -->
3. Your cost of aquisition for software should be minimal (license plus training etc.) and the ongoing cost should be predicatable <!-- .element: class="fragment" data-fragment-index="3" -->
4. Your TCO calculations should include the Cost of Exit and should be factored in during the selection process <!-- .element: class="fragment" data-fragment-index="4" -->
5. Your exposure to Vendor lock-in should be minimised and you should be able to walk away and keep the bits <!-- .element: class="fragment" data-fragment-index="5" -->
6. You shouldn't pay for upgrades! <!-- .element: class="fragment" data-fragment-index="6" -->

### And some bonus rules for Open Source
#### Though you might apply them to proprietary software too <!-- .element: class="fragment" data-fragment-index="1" -->

1. What is the size and adoption of the community behind this solution? Is it still growing? <!-- .element: class="fragment" data-fragment-index="2" -->
2. How open is the community? Does the license allow the community to fork the code?  <!-- .element: class="fragment" data-fragment-index="3" -->

## Red Hat's Model: Community Powered Innovation
### Does it meet Jeremy's rules?  <!-- .element: class="fragment" data-fragment-index="1" -->

## Many variations vendors take on open source

* Some enable optimizations for their hardware <!-- .element: class="fragment" data-fragment-index="1" -->
* Some use open-core to upsell proprietary add-ons <!-- .element: class="fragment" data-fragment-index="2" -->
* Some invest in focused areas <!-- .element: class="fragment" data-fragment-index="3" -->
* Some contribute little and soley ship and support <!-- .element: class="fragment" data-fragment-index="4" -->

## AND SOME...
# GO ALL IN <!-- .element: class="fragment" data-fragment-index="1" -->

## Is Open Source a Business Model?

* No <!-- .element: class="fragment" data-fragment-index="1" -->
* But it is the best DEVELOPMENT model on the planet <!-- .element: class="fragment" data-fragment-index="2" -->
* Enables collaboration <!-- .element: class="fragment" data-fragment-index="3" -->
* Gives users flexibility to consume on their terms <!-- .element: class="fragment" data-fragment-index="4" -->

## What links all of these technologies?

![Gartner Nexus of Forces](img/gartnerNexusOfForces.png) <!-- .element: class="noshadow" style="float: right" --> <!-- .element: class="fragment" data-fragment-index="2" -->

* Android
* Facebook
* Amazon WS
* Hadoop
* Linux
* OpenStack

All based on Open Source, the engine of innovation <!-- .element: class="fragment" data-fragment-index="1" -->
